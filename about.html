# About Me

I grew up in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where the Inceptisols of the foothills meet the Vertisols of the Great Plains. I grew up on a ranch and learned at a young age what it meant to live off the land, but my appreciation for soil didn't fully develop until I found myself in a soils class at the University of Wyoming. The Aridisols of the Mountain West will always have a special place in my heart as the first place I truly learned about soil. The passion turned into a desire to go to grad school, so I moved to the Mollisols of the Midwest to get my PhD at the University of Minnesota. While Soil Judging trips took me all over the Midwest describing soils, my research focused on the Gelisols and Histosols of Alaska (and to a lesser extent, Canada). I fell in love with permafrost-affected soils and the vast ruggedness of Alaskan landscapes. So when an Assistant Professor of Soil Science position opened up at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I immediately jumped at the opportunity to make a career out of cryopedology, teaching and performing research in Alaska.
